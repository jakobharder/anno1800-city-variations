# Factory Variants

Shift+V variations for production buildings.

AI will also build these variations.

âš  If you are missing ground textures: make sure to update `[Shared] Ground Textures`.

Buildings:

- Fur Dealer: 3 new variations
- Bakery: 2 new variations (+ Shift+G for stone pavement)
- Cannery: 2 new variations
- more will follow ...

## Notes

`Shift+V` is blocked on already built buildings.
You can either change the variation before you build it, or pick it up again and change then.
